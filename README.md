# Introduction
Music Discuss is a web application where new topics of singles of new release music is discussed and debated.
The goal of this web application is to provide users with a complete honest review on new release music and give a suggestion on how a artist may can update or improve a exisiting song. 

# Features
Instead of the usual normal ratings as a album as a whole.  Each new song from a new release album or new single will be given a detailed investigatation from users.  User may talk about parts of the songs that seem interesting, didnâ€™t make sense, or what a artist could improve on to satisfy a the listeners need.  
* Give Thumbs Down or Thumbs Up
* Give score out of 5
* Provide feedback comments to each songs
* Full Discussion of song

# Structure 
This web application will need to follow as a open ended review/discussion.  I'm more on the side of making everything a scroll based web application.  Everything will only be based on only music.  Music that has been licenesed or music that may be from other independent services such as spinrilla, soundclound, datpiff etc.  

# Goal
The goal of this web application is to present artists a open source work platform to where they can maybe update their own singles and possibily change productions, sounds, possibly could add other artists, and complete a song to its best ability.  This application may can give artist a idea of improvment on songs and could give their own listeners something that they may can improve on.
